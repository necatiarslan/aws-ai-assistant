- Switch profiles, regions, and endpoints using your local AWS CLI credentials.
- Test connectivity via STS GetCallerIdentity before running commands.
- Browse CloudWatch Logs, invoke Lambda functions, interact with SQS/SNS, manage EC2 resources, work with S3 objects, and query RDS/DynamoDB with guided prompts.
- Use VS Code commands and the status bar to change AWS context quickly.

## ❓ Q & A
- **Q**: How does Goggles authenticate to AWS?
- **A**: It uses your existing AWS credentials configured locally (via AWS CLI config, SSO, environment variables, etc.) and the AWS SDK provider chain.

- **Q**: Are my AWS credentials stored by the extension?
- **A**: No, credentials are not persisted outside VS Code global state. You can refresh or clear cached credentials from the Command Palette.

- **Q**: What permissions are required?
- **A**: The extension invokes AWS APIs using your account permissions. Use least-privilege IAM policies and verify the active profile before running mutating actions.

- **Q**: Can I use this extension with multiple AWS accounts?
- **A**: Yes, you can switch profiles using the status bar AWS selector or commands in the Command Palette.

- **Q**: Is there any cost associated with using this extension?
- **A**: The extension itself is free to use, but AWS API calls may incur costs based on your usage and AWS pricing.

- **Q**: Are my AWS Credentials exposed to Copilot or other AI services?
- **A**: No, your AWS Credentials are handled locally by the extension and are not sent to any external AI services.

- **Q**: Is it possible the extension could perform unintended actions on my AWS account?
- **A**: The extension always gets confirmation from you for the actions below before executing them:
   - put, post, upload, download, delete, copy, create, update, insert, commit, rollback, send, publish, invoke, start, execute. 
   - List, get, describe, search, scan, query actions are read-only and safe.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- AWS credentials configured locally (via AWS CLI config, SSO, environment variables, or other supported methods).

## 📋 Quick Start

1. **Set profile/region**: Use the status bar AWS selector or run "Goggles: Set AWS Profile" / "Goggles: Set Default Region" from the Command Palette.
2. **Test connectivity**: Run "Goggles: Test AWS Connectivity" to verify STS access.
3. **Open Chat**: Open Chat (@aws) and ask a question, for example:
   - List my S3 buckets
   - Tail the latest CloudWatch log events for /aws/lambda/my-fn
   - Describe EC2 instances in us-west-2
   - Publish a message to my SNS topic
4. **Review results**: The assistant will call the appropriate tool, stream results, and suggest follow-up actions.

## 👮 Authentication & Security

- **Credentials**: Resolved via the AWS SDK provider chain. The selected profile is stored in VS Code global state and reapplied across sessions.
- **Privacy**: No credentials are persisted outside VS Code global state. You can refresh or clear cached credentials from the Command Palette.
- **Permissions**: The assistant invokes AWS APIs using your account permissions. Use least-privilege IAM policies and verify the active profile before running mutating actions.
